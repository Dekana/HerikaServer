fishy_stick,"The fishy stick is a long-running inside joke and tradition among the Elder Scrolls community. It originated in 2001 on the Official Forums when a user named Captain Eldrad began awarding fishy sticks—represented by an image from a Captain Morgan's rum ad, modified to show a fish stick instead of a bottle of rum—to members who he felt deserved recognition. Over time, this humorous gesture evolved into a welcoming tradition where experienced forum members would give fishy sticks to newcomers as a form of initiation.

The popularity of the fishy stick has led to multiple tributes within the Elder Scrolls games. In Morrowind, players can find the book Capn's Guide to the Fishy Stick, though it is unreadable due to being smeared with fishy stick sauce. Oblivion features a quote from M'aiq the Liar about wanting a stick made of fish. In Skyrim, Sheogorath references ""doing the fishstick"" during the quest The Mind of Madness. In Elder Scrolls Online, fishy sticks can be cooked as part of the Provisioning skill, and the default name for a Palomino horse is ""Fishystick."" Even Elder Scrolls: Legends includes references, with characters like Artaeum Savant and Manic Jack using the phrase in their summon and attack lines"
