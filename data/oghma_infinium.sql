This artifact often takes the form of a rose, though it may also appear as a wooden stave shaped like one.

This distinctive staff, often adorned with engravings of angry, gaping faces, embodies the unpredictable and chaotic nature of its creator. The Wabbajack possesses the power to transform its target into a completely random creature, making it a double-edged sword in combat. While it can convert a formidable foe into a harmless animal, it may just as easily turn a weak opponent into a fearsome monster.

Akatosh is also closely associated with the founding of the Cyrodilic Empire. His blood was mystically joined with that of the first human Empress, Alessia, creating a divine covenant that protected the Empire from Daedric influence, symbolized by the Amulet of Kings. His role in maintaining the cosmic order is further emphasized during significant historical events like the Oblivion Crisis, where the Septim Emperor Martin transformed into Akatosh''s fiery avatar to defeat the Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon.

Her followers, especially in nature-based religions, view her as a provider of life and the elements, with shrines located in natural settings rather than urban temples. She is closely associated with rain, storms, and the natural world, and her artifacts, like the Boots of the Crusader and the Lord’s Mail, are highly prized for their connection to her divine protection and power. In other cultures, such as the Khajiit, Kynareth is known as Khenarthi, the goddess who guides souls to the afterlife.');

Their influence and authority extend across Imperial territories, though their main focus remains in Cyrodiil.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('lorkhan', 'Lorkhan, also known as the Missing God, is a central figure in Tamrielic myth, often regarded as the Creator, Trickster, and Tester of mortals. Revered and reviled, Lorkhan''s influence is woven into every culture’s mythology, and he is credited with initiating the creation of the mortal plane, Nirn. He convinced the et''Ada, the Original Spirits, to create Mundus, the world, disrupting the cosmic order. Following the world''s creation, Lorkhan was separated from his divine essence—most commonly through the removal of his Heart—and exiled from the divine realm. This event, referred to as the "shattering of Lorkhan," is depicted as a punishment for his role in the creation of the flawed mortal realm, though some legends suggest he willingly accepted this fate.

The perceptions of Lorkhan vary greatly between different races. To the Elves, he is a deceiver responsible for trapping them in the mortal realm, severing their connection to the spiritual plane. The Altmer view him as the ultimate antagonist, a being who imprisoned them in a world of suffering and limitation. Conversely, humans, especially Nords and Imperials, honor him as a heroic figure. In Skyrim, he is worshipped as Shor, the god who sacrificed himself to create the world. Redguards know him as Sep, a trickster who helped shape the mortal world but was cursed for his transgressions. Reachmen revere him as the Spirit of Man, while Khajiit associate him with Lorkhaj, the Moon Beast, whose heart''s corruption birthed the dark dro-m’Athra.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('trinimac', 'Trinimac, known as the Warrior and the Paragon, was a prominent god of the early Aldmer and considered one of the most powerful et''Ada. Revered as the champion of Auri-El and a warrior spirit, Trinimac played a significant role in Aldmeri legends, particularly in the conflict against Lorkhan. He was known for his strength and leadership, often depicted holding his sword, Penitent (Vosh Rakh, the "Blade of Courage"). Trinimac was especially venerated by the Altmer, Ayleids, and early Orcs, and was regarded as a god who stood for strength, honor, and unity. However, his legacy is deeply entwined with his transformation into Malacath, a Daedric Prince, after an encounter with Boethiah.

According to legend, Boethiah consumed Trinimac and took on his form to spread new teachings among the Aldmer, leading to the creation of the Chimer and Orcs. Boethiah''s act of devouring Trinimac resulted in his followers transforming into the Orsimer (Orcs), and Trinimac himself was reborn as Malacath, a weaker and vengeful version of his former self. While many Orcs continued to worship Malacath, others maintained belief in the purity of Trinimac. During the Second Era, leaders like King Kurog and King Gortwog revived the worship of Trinimac, positioning him as a god of unity and civilization, in contrast to the savage nature associated with Malacath. Trinimac’s story remains central to the identity and history of the Orcs and is a key figure in the cultural divergence between Chimer and Orsimer.');
INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('talos', 'Talos, also known as Tiber Septim, was a legendary figure who rose to prominence as the first Emperor of the unified Tamriel and later ascended to godhood. In life, Talos conquered all of Tamriel, founding the Third Empire and ushering in the Third Era. Born in Atmora, his birth name, Talos, means "Stormcrown" in the ancient Ehlnofey language. Throughout his military and political career, he was also known by other titles, including Ysmir, Dragon of the North, the Grey Wind, and Storm of Kyne. His legendary conquests culminated in the subjugation of the Aldmeri Dominion, leading to his later veneration by humans as the "Hero-God of Mankind." Upon his death in 3E 38, Tiber Septim is believed to have ascended to become the ninth Divine, joining the pantheon of the Eight Divines as Talos.

Talos is revered as the patron of warriors, adventurers, and rulers, symbolizing the virtues of strength, courage, and leadership. His divine status, however, is a point of contention, especially among the Altmer, who view his apotheosis with hostility due to his conquest of their lands. In the Fourth Era, worship of Talos was banned following the White-Gold Concordat between the Aldmeri Dominion and the Empire, which claimed that a man could not achieve godhood. This ban ignited the Skyrim Civil War, with the Stormcloaks, led by Ulfric Stormcloak, rebelling in defense of their right to worship Talos. Despite the ban, Talos remains a powerful symbol of unity and strength for many, particularly among the Nords and other human races. Amulets of Talos, often crafted from dragonbone and scales, are used by his followers to invoke his blessing and strength in their endeavors.');

Known by many names, such as the Dark Warrior, Deceiver of Nations, and Goddess of Destruction, Boethiah''s influence is often destructive yet foundational for change. Her sphere of influence revolves around inspiring mortals to act through cruelty and violence, making battle and death seen as blessings in her view.

Boethiah is a shapeshifter and frequently changes form, appearing as either male or female, sometimes within the same narrative. Her realm of Oblivion is called Attribution’s Share, a twisted landscape filled with plots, betrayals, and endless challenges. She often tests mortals by pitting them against each other in deadly contests, fostering a culture where strength, treachery, and cunning are paramount.');

He is often depicted alongside his loyal companion, Barbas, a shapeshifting Daedra who frequently takes the form of a dog. Barbas holds a portion of Clavicus Vile''s power, leading to speculation that the two may be halves of the same being. Vile''s realm, the Fields of Regret, is a tranquil and idyllic landscape that reflects his playful but deceptive nature.

Clavicus Vile is known for his sophisticated and calculating approach, making deals that often ensnare those who seek his help. Despite his love for manipulation, he is not always malevolent and has, on occasion, acted in ways that benefit the greater good, though always with his interests in mind. His notable artifacts include the Masque of Clavicus Vile, which grants charm to its wearer, and the Umbra Sword, a soul-trapping blade tied to sentient power.

Often referred to as the Demon of Knowledge or Gardener of Men, Mora''s insatiable curiosity leads him to amass all information that exists or ever will exist. He is not concerned with altering fate but rather with ensuring that nothing remains unknown. Mora is known to entrap mortals with the lure of forbidden knowledge, offering immense power in exchange for their servitude. However, this knowledge often comes at a high cost, as mortals who delve too deeply into his secrets risk madness or the loss of their identity.

Mora resides in Apocrypha, his plane of Oblivion, an infinite library filled with untitled black books containing forbidden secrets. The realm is populated by his servants, including Seekers and Lurkers, grotesque creatures that enforce Mora''s will. Mortals who journey to Apocrypha through his Black Books often face peril but may gain valuable knowledge if they can survive its horrors. Mora is also associated with the Oghma Infinium, a powerful artifact containing vast knowledge.

Lycanthropes are often considered his "children," and he claims their souls to serve him in the afterlife, where they join him in his realm, the Hunting Grounds. Hircine''s realm is an endless forest teeming with fierce creatures and Daedra, where eternal hunts and battles occur in a cycle of death and rebirth.

Hircine is revered across Tamriel, particularly among those who seek power through lycanthropy or respect the primal forces of nature. He manifests in several aspects, each symbolizing a different form of the hunt, such as the wolf, bear, and fox. Though he is known for his sportsmanship and values fairness in the hunt, his followers and cults sometimes take his worship to brutal extremes. Among his most prominent cults are the Reachfolk, who honor Hircine as the source of their survival and martial prowess, and the Glenmoril Wyrd, who practice lycanthropy and serve his will. His summoning day is the 5th of Mid Year, and he is associated with several powerful artifacts, including the Ring of Hircine and the Savior’s Hide, which grant protection and control over lycanthropy.');

His origin is closely tied to this transformation, where Trinimac was either devoured or humiliated by Boethiah and subsequently twisted into the vengeful being known as Malacath.

Malacath is particularly revered by the Orsimer (Orcs), who regard him as their patron deity. Orcs live by the Code of Mauloch, a set of rules that values honor, vengeance, and strength. Orcish strongholds follow these principles, with their leaders and warriors often invoking Malacath in their daily lives. However, some Orcs believe that Trinimac still exists as a separate entity and that Malacath is a different being entirely, leading to tension within Orcish culture.');

Sheogorath is notorious for his bizarre, sadistic, and whimsical behavior, often treating mortals and even other Daedric Princes as his playthings. His appearance is usually that of a well-dressed, eccentric man wielding a cane, which contrasts sharply with his unpredictable and dangerous nature. Legends tell that Sheogorath was once Jyggalag, the Daedric Prince of Order, but was cursed by the other Daedric Princes to embody the chaos he once despised. This curse led to the recurring Greymarch, during which Jyggalag would briefly reclaim his form before reverting back to Sheogorath.

Sheogorath is revered and feared in many cultures, especially among the Khajiit, who call him the Skooma Cat, and the Dunmer, who regard him as one of the Four Corners of the House of Troubles.

Throughout his conquests across Tamriel, Pelinal is said to have embodied both heroism and chaos, often succumbing to bouts of madness that drove him to indiscriminately slay enemies and alter the very landscape.

Pelinal is remembered by many titles, including Pelinal the Bloody, the Divine Crusader, and Pelinal Insurgent, with some legends suggesting he had incarnated multiple times. His connection to Queen Alessia was profound, with their names occasionally combined to signify their unity in the fight for freedom.

Additionally, it was famous for The Bestiary, a collection of dangerous creatures cared for by trolls.

As one of the legendary Towers that help stabilize the Mundus, the Crystal Tower existed concurrently across all realms of the Aurbis, functioning as a gateway to various realities. The summit of the tower housed the Tower''s Stone, known as Transparent Law, which has been theorized to bestow omnipresence within the Aurbis upon its controller. To prevent misuse of this power, the Sapiarchs created two Resolute Diamonds, artifacts that must be attuned to before entry into the Crystal Tower is granted.

The Night of Tears, a tragic event in which the Snow Elves attacked the human settlement of Saarthal, is often attributed to tensions between the two races. While some Elven scholars claim that Ysgramor''s actions provoked this attack, many believe it was unprovoked, resulting in the massacre of most humans in the settlement, save for Ysgramor and his two sons, Yngol and Ylgar. After fleeing to Atmora, Ysgramor returned with the legendary Five Hundred Companions and launched a campaign against the Elves, successfully driving them from Skyrim and Solstheim. Wielding the axe Wuuthrad and accompanied by a Storm Atronach Bear summoned by his Clever Man, Alabar the Oddly-Colored, Ysgramor solidified his status as a cultural hero of the Nords.

Ysgramor is also credited with being the first human historian, having transcribed Nordic speech using Elven writing principles. His legacy endures through the Companions, who regard him as their true leader, and his descendants ruled Skyrim until the death of King Borgas in 1E 369, marking the end of his direct lineage.

As a result, dragons held a position of supremacy over mankind, with dragon priests serving as their powerful intermediaries, enforcing laws and maintaining order in society. Temples were erected to honor these dragons, many of which remain as draugr-infested ruins today.

However, over time, the Dragon Cult became increasingly oppressive, establishing their capital at Bromjunaar in what is now Hjaalmarch and effectively enslaving the Nordic populace. This shift in demeanor is believed to have been influenced by Alduin, the First-Born of Akatosh, who sought to dominate Mundus. The ensuing discontent led to the ancient Dragon War, in which humans, aided by some dragons, eventually triumphed over Alduin and his cult. The dragon priests were overthrown, and the dragons were driven into hiding. Despite their fall, the Dragon Cult adapted, preserving the practice of constructing dragon mounds for the remains of fallen dragons, as they awaited the day of their return.

This event triggered a tumultuous period known as the Stormcrown Interregnum, characterized by intense power struggles over the Ruby Throne. The interregnum concluded in 4E 22 when Titus Mede, a Colovian warlord, seized the Imperial City from the unpopular Nibenese battlemage Thules the Gibbering. Supported by Hierem, an influential figure from an old Nibenese family, Mede was crowned Emperor, establishing the Mede Dynasty.

Despite his efforts to restore order, the aftermath of the Oblivion Crisis had weakened Imperial control over its provinces, leading to widespread secession. Between 4E 1 and 4E 29, Black Marsh, Elsweyr, and Summerset Isle (renamed Alinor) broke away from the Empire. Morrowind faced devastation from the eruption of Red Mountain and an Argonian invasion, effectively ending its status as an Imperial province. The situation worsened under the reign of Titus Mede II, culminating in the Great War when the Aldmeri Dominion invaded in 4E 171. The conflict concluded in 4E 175 with the White-Gold Concordat, which forced Titus II to relinquish Hammerfell.

As part of the treaty''s conditions, the Aldmeri Dominion was required to withdraw all military forces from the region, solidifying Hammerfell''s status as an independent nation, albeit a diminished one.

The treaty''s aftermath left lingering tensions between Hammerfell and the Empire. Many Redguards viewed Emperor Titus Mede II''s earlier acceptance of the White-Gold Concordat, which had concluded the Great War, as a betrayal. This agreement had required the cession of significant territory in Hammerfell to the Dominion and ultimately led to the Empire renouncing Hammerfell as a province when it protested the treaty''s terms. In response to these events, a clandestine organization known as the Remnants was formed in Hammerfell, tasked with ensuring that the Aldmeri Dominion adhered to the treaty and investigating any potential violations.');

Torygg respected Ulfric''s passionate stance and sought to engage him in dialogue about his views, unaware that Ulfric had come with the intention of challenging him for the throne.

The encounter between Torygg and Ulfric culminated in tragedy, as Ulfric used his thu''um to overpower the young king and subsequently killed him. While Ulfric viewed the act as a rightful challenge for leadership, many—including the Empire and several Jarls—considered it regicide, noting Torygg''s limited martial training compared to Ulfric''s experience as a war veteran.

Those who achieve CHIM are rumored to possess the ability to reshape the world, with some legends claiming that Tiber Septim used this power to transform Cyrodiil from an endless jungle into a temperate land.

The process of attaining CHIM is one of the six "Walking Ways" to divinity. Vivec, a revered figure in Dunmer history, wrote extensively on CHIM, attributing its discovery to Lorkhan, who allegedly used this knowledge to enlist the Aedra in creating Mundus. Though his attempt at CHIM failed, some suggest this failure served as a cautionary example for others. CHIM is often seen as a step toward the ultimate state known as Amaranth, a union with the Godhead that resembles lucid dreaming, where two beings are required to "mantle" the Godhead, experiencing a dreamlike creation beyond all constraints.');
